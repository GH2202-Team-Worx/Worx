This project's focus was to design an e-commerce website for Bell's Custom Worx, a family company specializing in making beautiful wood furnishings and home decor. The website was built using JavaScript, React, Redux, Node, Express, Sequelize, Stripe, React-Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.

## User Functionality
As a guest, the user is able to browse products, add to cart, and checkout with items stored in localStorage.

As a logged-in user, the user is able to browse products, add to cart, checkout, and view their user profile including current and past orders. Both guests and users are able to send an email to Bell's Custom Worx from the Contact Us page.

As an admin, one is able to add products, view current orders, filter orders by status, and change the status of current orders. Admins are able to promote user accounts to admin status and delete users.
